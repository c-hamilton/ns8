My process:

Got the basic API set up by following this tutorial https://auth0.com/blog/use-typescript-to-create-a-secure-api-with-nodejs-and-express-getting-started/

I've made an API before and used node before on the backend but never made an express API so it seemed like a good idea to get that running first. Then I dived in to the specific requirements of this system.


For getting testing setup I followed this tutorial: https://itnext.io/writing-tests-in-your-node-js-api-application-cfb5592df466. I love automated tests and thing they are really important for request/response validation (especially if we need to be backwards compatible with an upstream or downstream system).

Obviously there is a lot more I would add to this system before putting the system into production.
